# History

0.7 : Refactored away the hashes of timers in favor of storing timer IDs directly on nodes.     
0.6 : Corrected overlapping dropdown menus (added z-index to items).     
0.5 : Initial Commit.

Started at 0.5 since I've written this a dozen times and it _should_ closely resemble what aready sits on several production websites.
